Reactive Maps Iron
==================

This is a version of [dburles/reactive-maps-example](https://github.com/dburles/reactive-maps-example).

It differs from the original example as follows:

* Iron meteor provides the basic project structure.
* Iron router provides routing.
* The map page is full screen

Unneeded portions of the iron meteor generated code are commented out but left in these sources as an
aid to those unfamiliar with iron meteor.
